# Dotfiles and Setup Scripts

## Setup
Run either `bootstrap_mac.sh -i` or `bootstrap_linux.sh -i` to install on a new system.  
This will also install a bunch of applications. This could also be used to update applications.

## Dotfiles
Run either `bootstrap_mac.sh -f` or `bootstrap_linux.sh -f` to force rsync changes to `~/`. 
(No force without the `-f` flag)

## Testing
- `vagrant up` to initialize the vm
- follow the steps described in `SETUPVM.md`
